# Rifampicin-Bupropion-DDI
Modeling of published clinical Rifampicin-Bupropion DD(G)I studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the bupropion model regarding the rifampicin-bupropion-DD(G)I, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied rifampicin model has been published previously [[1](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/psp4.12343)]. For further details and documentation please refer to [[2](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/13/3/331)].

## Version information

PK-Sim Version 9.1.
